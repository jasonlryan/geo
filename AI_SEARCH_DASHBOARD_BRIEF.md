# AI Search Intelligence Dashboard - New Design Brief

## The Problem We're Solving

Marketers don't understand how AI search works, so they can't interpret the data. The current dashboard shows confusing metrics without context, making it useless for strategic decision-making.

## Core Educational Mission

**FIRST: Educate users about AI search mechanics**
**THEN: Provide actionable intelligence**

## Dashboard Structure (Top to Bottom)

### 1. üéì "How AI Search Actually Works" (Education Panel)

**Purpose**: Give marketers the foundation to understand the data below

**Content**:

- Simple 3-step funnel visual: Discovery ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Citation
- Key insight: "Not all discovered sources get cited"
- Explanation: "AI finds many sources but only cites the most trustworthy ones"
- Citation success rate for this query: "X% of found sources actually got cited"

### 2. üìä "Your AI Search Performance" (Reality Check)

**Purpose**: Show what actually happened with this search

**Metrics**:

- Sources Discovered: X (AI found these when searching)
- Sources Cited: Y (AI actually referenced these)
- Citation Success Rate: Y/X% (industry benchmark: ~15-25%)
- Your Opportunity: "Low/Medium/High competition space"

### 3. üèÜ "Who Gets Cited (And Why)" (Competitive Intelligence)

**Purpose**: Show only sources that actually got citations + analysis

**Two columns**:

- **Left**: Cited Sources Only

  - Domain names with citation counts
  - Content type that got cited (guide, data, news)
  - Authority signals (gov, academic, industry expert)

- **Right**: Why They Won
  - Content format analysis
  - Authority signals present
  - What made them citation-worthy

### 4. ‚ùå "Why Sources Get Ignored" (Learning Panel)

**Purpose**: Educational - show what doesn't work

**Content**:

- "X sources were found but not cited"
- Common reasons: Generic content, no data, promotional tone, poor structure
- Example domains (without naming/shaming): "recruitment companies with basic service pages"

### 5. üéØ "Your Content Strategy Fix" (Action Plan)

**Purpose**: Specific, actionable recommendations

**Based on the data**:

- If high competition: "Focus on unique angles and exceptional quality"
- If low citations: "AI prefers authoritative guides over company pages"
- If specific gaps: "Create content about [specific topic] - no good sources found"
- Format recommendations: "Add data and research to your content"

### 6. üìà "Success Metrics to Track" (Measurement)

**Purpose**: How to measure progress

**Content**:

- Run this analysis monthly for your key topics
- Track citation rate improvement over time
- Monitor competitor citation success
- Measure content format performance

## Key Design Principles

1. **Education First**: Always explain what the data means
2. **Separate Winners from Losers**: Don't mix cited and non-cited sources
3. **Actionable Insights**: Every metric must lead to a specific action
4. **Avoid Confusion**: No jargon without explanation
5. **Professional Presentation**: Suitable for stakeholder meetings

## What to Remove from Current Dashboard

‚ùå "Winning Publishers" showing non-cited sources
‚ùå Generic advice not based on actual data
‚ùå Technical jargon without explanation
‚ùå Mixing found sources with cited sources
‚ùå Empty placeholder sections

## Success Criteria

A marketing manager should be able to:

1. Understand how AI search works (education)
2. See exactly what happened with their search (performance)
3. Know why some sources get cited and others don't (intelligence)
4. Get specific actions to improve their content (strategy)
5. Present findings to stakeholders (professional)

## Key Message

**"AI search finds many sources but only cites the best ones. Here's what makes content citation-worthy and how to improve yours."**
