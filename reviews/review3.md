Great question — and yes, “operouter” → you probably mean OpenRouter. Here’s the short list I’d use to power an AI-research pipeline like yours (Tavily today + a couple of complementary providers), plus what each one is good for and how it fits your codebase.

The shortlist (what to use & why)
LLM‑native search (answers with citations)

Perplexity API – purpose‑built for real‑time, web‑grounded answers and returns citations in the response. You can even tune how much web context to pull with search_context_size. Ideal when you want the model to decide what to read and justify it.
Perplexity

OpenAI “web search” tool (Responses API) – not a separate “Search API”, but you can turn on web search inside a normal OpenAI responses call via the tools array. Good if you already use OpenAI for composition and want one vendor for both generation and browsing.
OpenAI Platform

OpenRouter “web” plugin / :online models – wraps browsing around any model you call through OpenRouter (e.g., openai/gpt-4o:online or openrouter/auto with "plugins":[{"id":"web"}]). Handy if you want the model catalog + consistent “browse” behavior without building your own tool plumbing.
OpenRouter

General web index APIs (fast, broad coverage)

Brave Search API – modern, privacy‑centric, straightforward JSON web results (plus news/image/video endpoints) and a “summarizer/AI grounding” layer you can opt into. Great default for neutral, high‑quality SERPs that don’t require Google.
Brave

Bing Web Search API (Azure) – long‑standing, global coverage with market/locale controls and rich result objects. Solid complementary index to reduce single‑provider bias.
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft

Google Programmable Search Engine (Custom Search JSON API) – Google’s official way to programmatically get Google‑powered results. Requires a Programmable Search Engine (cx) and quotas, and results are within that engine (can be “search the entire web”, but still PSE). Use when you specifically need Google or site‑restricted search.
Google for Developers

Proxies / meta‑providers (use with care)

SerpAPI / searchapi.io / BrightData SERP API – give you normalized JSON from Google and other engines via scraping + anti‑bot handling. Popular, but confirm ToS/compliance for your use case. Consider only when the official APIs above don’t meet needs.

Where Hugging Face fits

Hugging Face doesn’t run a first‑party web search engine; instead they ship agent/tooling that calls search providers (Brave by default in smolagents, or DuckDuckGo/Serper in examples). If you’re building an agent on HF, you’ll still plug in one of the APIs above.

Quick recommendations for your stack
You already integrated Tavily (good choice for LLM‑friendly results). I’d add:

Brave Search API as a second, general index → diversify sources and improve recall.
Brave

Bing Web Search API for coverage & locale breadth.
Microsoft Learn

Perplexity API (or OpenAI web search tool) for model‑driven browsing with citations when you want the model to read/summarize live pages. Pick one to keep costs/simple.
Perplexity
OpenAI Platform

Keep Google PSE for site‑restricted searches or when a stakeholder insists on “Google‑like” results (know the constraints vs consumer google.com).
Google for Developers

How each integrates (maps cleanly to your codebase)
Your backend already has providers/ with TavilySearchProvider. Clone that pattern:

BraveSearchProvider → POST https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search with your API key; map results[].url/title/description into ProviderResult.
Brave

BingSearchProvider → GET https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search with Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key; map webPages.value[].
Microsoft Learn

GooglePSEProvider → GET https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=...&cx=...&q=...; map items[]. (Be explicit about your engine cx.)
Google for Developers

PerplexityProvider (LLM mode) → call Perplexity’s /chat/completions with an “online” model (e.g., Sonar) and parse citations from the response; store them into your evidence graph.
Perplexity

OpenAIWebSearchProvider (LLM mode) → call the OpenAI Responses API with tools: [{"type":"web_search"}] and parse the tool output (URLs/snippets) into your fetched_docs/evidence.
OpenAI Platform

OpenRouterProvider → same shape, but send "plugins":[{"id":"web"}] or use :online models if you want browsing with non‑OpenAI models; normalize citations where provided.
OpenRouter

Then update search_pipeline.run_search() to fan out across multiple providers, dedupe by canonical URL, and keep the best‑scoring N per query variant (you already have the scaffold for dedupe + variants).

Which to prefer for “research‑grade” citations
Best “model reads the web and cites”: Perplexity API (explicit citations; controllable retrieval depth), or OpenAI Responses with web search if you’re already standardizing on OpenAI.
Perplexity
OpenAI Platform

Best “pure search index”: Brave (clean JSON, active dev, AI‑friendly) + Bing (coverage). Pair them for diversity.
Brave
Microsoft Learn

When you truly need Google: Programmable Search JSON API (accept the PSE engine model & quotas).
Google for Developers

Notes on reliability & trade‑offs
OpenAI: There isn’t a separate public “Search API”; the official path is enabling web search as a tool in the Responses API. That’s production‑supported and documented.
OpenAI Platform

OpenRouter: The web plugin lets you add browsing to any model; you can even shorthand with :online suffixes. Great flexibility if you want Claude/Gemini/others to browse behind one API.
OpenRouter

Perplexity: Built around web‑grounded answers and returning citations; recently added more explicit control like search_context_size. If “explain and cite” matters, it’s a strong fit.
Perplexity

Google PSE: Official and stable, but remember you’re querying a Programmable Search Engine (your cx), not the raw consumer google.com; expectations should be set accordingly.
Google for Developers

Brave/Bing: Both are well‑documented, production‑grade, and easy to normalize (JSON). Using both reduces bias from any single index.
Brave
Microsoft Learn

Hugging Face: Treat HF as the agent framework layer. Their built‑in web‑search tool calls out to an API like Brave under the hood — not a first‑party search index.
Hugging Face

If you want, I can sketch provider classes for Brave/Bing/Google that drop into your backend/app/services/providers/ folder and a tiny scoring/merge step for search_pipeline.py. This will give you (1) broader coverage, (2) better citations, and (3) fewer “surprising” corporate links bubbling up.
