# Styling Consistency Fixes

## Problem Identified

The 3 pages (Search, About, Insights) had completely inconsistent styling approaches:

- **Search page**: Mixed hardcoded Tailwind classes with some design system components
- **About page**: Used Tailwind prose with completely different styling
- **Insights page**: Minimal styling with different heading sizes
- **Layout**: Mixed design tokens with hardcoded Tailwind classes
- **Global CSS**: Outdated design tokens that weren't properly integrated

## Changes Made

### 1. Search Page (`/search`)

- ✅ Converted from hardcoded styling to design system components
- ✅ Updated to use `Card`, `Button`, `Spinner` components consistently
- ✅ Unified color scheme: `slate-*` colors throughout
- ✅ Consistent focus states and hover effects
- ✅ Professional tab styling with blue accent

### 2. Layout (`layout.tsx`)

- ✅ Removed inconsistent design token usage
- ✅ Applied consistent `slate-*` color scheme
- ✅ Modern header with backdrop blur and subtle shadow
- ✅ Improved navigation with proper hover states
- ✅ Consistent typography and spacing

### 3. About Page (`/about`)

- ✅ Complete restructure from prose to card-based layout
- ✅ Consistent with other pages using `Card` components
- ✅ Professional information hierarchy
- ✅ Unified color scheme and typography
- ✅ Better visual organization with grid layouts

### 4. Insights Page (`/insights`)

- ✅ Added proper page header with title and badge
- ✅ Wrapped content in `Card` component for consistency
- ✅ Unified typography scale

### 5. Global CSS (`globals.css`)

- ✅ Complete rewrite with modern design system
- ✅ Consistent typography scale using CSS custom properties
- ✅ Unified color scheme (slate-based)
- ✅ Modern radius, shadow, and spacing scales
- ✅ Enhanced focus states and form styling
- ✅ Proper component base styles

## Visual Results

- **Consistent color scheme**: All pages now use `slate-50` background, `slate-900` text, `blue-600` accents
- **Unified typography**: All headings use the same scale and font weights
- **Professional appearance**: Cards have subtle shadows, consistent borders, modern radius
- **Better UX**: Improved focus states, hover effects, and transitions
- **System coherence**: All 3 pages now look like they're from the same application

## Technical Improvements

- Proper design system component usage
- CSS custom properties for maintainability
- Tailwind utilities used consistently
- No more conflicting style approaches
- Better accessibility with focus rings
- Performance optimized with consistent class usage

The styling is now **visibly unified** across all 3 pages with a professional, modern appearance.
