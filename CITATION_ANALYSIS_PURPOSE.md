# AI Search Intelligence System - Core Purpose & Requirements

## NEVER FORGET THIS - THE CORE OBJECTIVE

### What We're Building:

**An AI Search Intelligence Platform FOR MARKETERS** - a business intelligence system that reverse-engineers AI search mechanisms to provide actionable content strategy insights for gaining AI visibility.

### The Business Problem We're Solving:

**"How do I get my content cited by AI search engines?"**

Marketing teams desperately need to understand:

- "Why doesn't ChatGPT/Claude cite our content when users ask about our industry?"
- "What types of sources do AI systems trust and prefer?"
- "Where should we publish content to get picked up by AI search?"
- "What content gaps exist that we could fill to dominate AI citations?"
- "Who's winning the AI citation game in our competitive landscape?"
- "What content formats and structures work best for AI discovery?"

### Target Audience:

**Marketing teams, content strategists, and brand managers** who want to:

- Optimize their content strategy for AI visibility
- Understand competitive positioning in AI search results
- Identify content gaps and opportunities
- Make data-driven decisions about where to publish

### User Journey:

1. **Marketer tests their topic area** - runs a search query related to their industry/competitive landscape
2. **System reverse-engineers AI behavior** - analyzes what sources AI search engines actually select and cite
3. **Educational foundation** - system explains how AI search actually works (discovery vs citation)
4. **One-click intelligence** - user clicks **"AI Search Intelligence"** button
5. **Instant insights modal** - comprehensive marketing dashboard opens with actionable intelligence
6. **Strategic recommendations** - user gets specific guidance on content strategy to improve AI visibility
7. **Shareable intelligence** - user downloads professional report for stakeholder meetings and team planning

### The Intelligence Dashboard Must Contain (Marketing Focus):

#### AI Search Performance Summary

- **Real metrics that matter**: Sources found, domain diversity, content gaps identified
- **Competitive positioning**: How saturated is this topic space?
- **Opportunity assessment**: Is this a good topic area to target?

#### "How AI Search Really Works" Education

- **The AI Search Funnel** - Discovery → Evaluation → Citation (not all found sources get cited)
- **Why sources get 0 citations** - content quality, relevance, authority issues
- **Discovery vs Citation** - being found ≠ being trusted enough to cite
- **What AI actually looks for** - data, structure, authority signals, specificity

#### "Who Actually Gets Cited?" Analysis

- **Citation success rate** - what percentage of discovered sources actually get cited
- **Cited vs Non-cited breakdown** - clear separation between winners and losers
- **Authority patterns** - what makes content citation-worthy to AI systems
- **Content format analysis** - which types of content AI prefers to reference

#### Content Strategy Intelligence

- **Content gaps** - specific topics/angles where no strong sources exist
- **Format recommendations** - what content types perform best (guides, data, case studies)
- **Publication venue strategy** - where to publish for maximum AI visibility
- **Competitive content analysis** - what's working for competitors

#### Immediate Action Plan

- **This quarter's priorities** - top 3 content initiatives to pursue
- **Content creation roadmap** - specific topics and formats to develop
- **Distribution strategy** - which platforms and partnerships to pursue
- **Success metrics** - how to measure progress over time
